## 🚀 How to Start Django Server

**IMPORTANT:** Always activate the virtual environment first!

### Option 1: Using PowerShell (Current Terminal)
```powershell
# Navigate to project root
cd D:\code\optR

# Activate virtual environment
.\virtual\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Navigate to Django project
cd OCR

# Start server
python manage.py runserver
```

### Option 2: Using CMD (Alternative)
```cmd
# Navigate to project root
cd D:\code\optR

# Activate virtual environment
virtual\Scripts\activate.bat

# Navigate to Django project
cd OCR

# Start server
python manage.py runserver
```

---

## 🔍 How to Verify Virtual Environment is Active

When the virtual environment is activated, you'll see `(virtual)` at the beginning of your command prompt:

```
(virtual) PS D:\code\optR\OCR>
```

If you don't see `(virtual)`, the environment is NOT activated.

## 📋 Quick Start Commands (Copy-Paste)

### PowerShell:
```powershell
cd D:\code\optR; .\virtual\Scripts\Activate.ps1; cd OCR; python manage.py runserver
```

### CMD:
```cmd
cd D:\code\optR && virtual\Scripts\activate.bat && cd OCR && python manage.py runserver
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Django won't start:
```powershell
# Make sure you're in the right place and virtual env is active
cd D:\code\optR
.\virtual\Scripts\Activate.ps1
cd OCR
python manage.py runserver
```

### If PDF preview still doesn't work:
1. Check server is running: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
2. Check virtual environment is active (look for `(virtual)` in prompt)
3. Run verification: `python test_poppler.py`
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### If Poppler stops working:
```powershell
# Test Poppler access
pdfinfo -v
pdftoppm -v

# Test from Python
python quick_test.py
```

## ✨ Next Steps

Now that PDF processing is working, you can:

1. ✅ Upload PDF templates
2. ✅ Preview PDFs in the interface
3. ✅ Process documents with PDF templates
4. ✅ Extract text from PDF documents
5. ✅ Generate PDF thumbnails

**All PDF functionality is now operational!** 🚀

## 💡 Pro Tip

To avoid having to activate the virtual environment every time:

**VS Code Setting:**
1. Press `Ctrl + ,` (Settings)
2. Search: "Python: Terminal Activate Environment"
3. Ensure it's **checked** ✅

This will automatically activate the virtual environment when you open a new terminal in VS Code.

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Windows File Handling:
1. **Close file handles explicitly** before operations
2. **Use try-finally** to ensure cleanup
3. **Add delay** on Windows before deleting files
4. **Don't delete inside context managers** when file handle is open

### PDF Processing Pipeline:
1. PDF → pdf2image (requires Poppler)
2. Image → Temporary PNG file
3. PNG → OCR (Tesseract/EasyOCR)
4. Cleanup → Delete temp file

### Error Prevention:
1. Check Poppler in PATH before processing
2. Proper exception handling for file operations
3. Cleanup temp files in finally blocks
4. Provide reprocess option for failed documents

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. Batch PDF processing
2. Multi-page PDF support (currently processes first page)
3. PDF page selection UI
4. Progress indicators for long PDFs
5. Automatic temp file cleanup on startup
6. Configurable temp directory

### Monitoring:
- Track OCR success rates
- Monitor temp directory usage
- Log processing times
- Alert on repeated failures

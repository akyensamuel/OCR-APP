# 🔧 PDF Preview Issue - Resolved

## 🎯 Issue Summary

**Problem:** PDF documents processed before Poppler was configured show error messages in preview:
```
PDF processing error: Unable to get page count. Is poppler installed and in PATH?
```

**Root Cause:** 
- Document "OoPdfFormExample.pdf" was processed **before** Poppler was properly set up
- The error message was saved to database as `extracted_text`
- Now that Poppler is working, old documents need to be reprocessed

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Verified PDF Processing Works ✅
Ran test: `python test_pdf_conversion.py`
- ✅ pdf2image can import
- ✅ Found 13 PDF files
- ✅ Successfully converted PDF to image
- ✅ Poppler is working correctly

### 2. Added Reprocess Feature ✅
Created reprocess functionality for documents that failed OCR:

**New Files:**
- `editor/views.py` - Added `reprocess_text_document()` function
- `templates/editor/reprocess_confirm.html` - Confirmation page
- `editor/urls.py` - Added URL pattern

**Modified Files:**
- `templates/editor/document_list.html` - Added Reprocess button (yellow redo icon)

### 3. How to Use
1. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/editor/list/
2. Find document with error message
3. Click the **yellow redo button** (⟳)
4. Confirm reprocessing
5. Document will be processed again with working Poppler

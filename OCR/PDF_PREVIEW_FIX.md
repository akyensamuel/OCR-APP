## üé¨ After Installing Poppler

Once Poppler is in your PATH, the application will automatically:
- Convert PDF pages to images for preview
- Show PDF templates in the View modal
- Display PDF documents in document preview
- Enable PDF thumbnail generation

---

## ‚ö° Alternative (If You Can't Modify PATH)

If you cannot add Poppler to system PATH, you can modify the code to specify the path directly.

See **POPPLER_SETUP.md** section "Alternative: Specify Poppler Path in Code"

---

## üêõ Current Error Explained

**Error Message:**
```
PDF processing error: Unable to get page count. Is poppler installed and in PATH?
```

**Why It Happens:**
- `pdf2image` library needs Poppler tools (`pdfinfo`, `pdftoppm`, `pdfimages`)
- These tools must be in system PATH or specified explicitly
- Without them, PDF files cannot be converted to images

**What Poppler Does:**
- Converts PDF pages ‚Üí PNG/JPG images
- Extracts PDF metadata (page count, dimensions)
- Required by `pdf2image` Python library

---

## üéØ Bottom Line

**You need to:**
1. Download Poppler Windows binaries
2. Add the `bin` folder to system PATH
3. Restart VS Code and Django server

**Time required:** ~5 minutes

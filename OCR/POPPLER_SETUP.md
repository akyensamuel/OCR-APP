# üöÄ Quick Poppler Setup Guide for PDF Preview

## Problem
You're seeing this error when viewing PDF templates:
```
PDF processing error: Unable to get page count. Is poppler installed and in PATH?
```

## What is Poppler?
Poppler is a PDF rendering library that converts PDF pages to images. It's required by the `pdf2image` Python library to display PDF previews in the application.

### Step 2: Extract and Place
1. Extract the ZIP file
2. Copy the entire folder to: `C:\Program Files\poppler-24.08.0\`
3. You should now have: `C:\Program Files\poppler-24.08.0\Library\bin\`

### Step 3: Add to System PATH
1. Press `Win + X` ‚Üí Select **System**
2. Click **Advanced system settings** (right side)
3. Click **Environment Variables** button
4. Under **System variables**, find and select **Path**
5. Click **Edit**
6. Click **New**
7. Add this path: `C:\Program Files\poppler-24.08.0\Library\bin`

## üîß Alternative: Specify Poppler Path in Code (Optional)

If you don't want to add Poppler to PATH, you can specify the path directly in the code:

**Edit `ocr_processing/utils.py`:**

Find the `convert_from_path` calls and add `poppler_path`:

```python
from pdf2image import convert_from_path

# Add poppler_path parameter
images = convert_from_path(
    pdf_path,
    poppler_path=r'C:\Program Files\poppler-24.08.0\Library\bin'
)
```

---

## üì¶ Python Package Status
‚úÖ **pdf2image** is now installed in your virtual environment

---

## üêß Linux/Mac Users

### Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

### macOS:
```bash
brew install poppler
```

---

## ‚ùì Still Having Issues?

### Check if Poppler is in PATH:
```cmd
where pdftoppm
where pdfinfo
```

If these commands don't work, Poppler is not in your PATH yet.

### Common Mistakes:
- ‚ùå Added wrong path to PATH (should be the `bin` folder)
- ‚ùå Didn't restart terminal after adding to PATH
- ‚ùå Didn't restart Django server after installing Poppler
- ‚ùå Downloaded wrong Poppler package (use oschwartz10612's Windows release)

### Quick Test Script:
```python
try:
    from pdf2image import convert_from_path
    print("‚úÖ pdf2image is installed")
    
    # This will fail if Poppler is not in PATH
    # but will tell you exactly what's wrong
    import subprocess
    result = subprocess.run(['pdfinfo', '-v'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode == 0:
        print("‚úÖ Poppler is accessible:", result.stdout.strip())
    else:
        print("‚ùå Poppler is not in PATH")
except ImportError:
    print("‚ùå pdf2image is not installed")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("‚ùå Poppler executables not found in PATH")
```

Save as `test_poppler.py` and run:
```cmd
python test_poppler.py
```
